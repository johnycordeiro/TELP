# TELP - Text Extraction with Linguistic Patterns

TELP is a powerful and intuitive tool designed to simplify the extraction of linguistic patterns from web texts. Developed with the needs of linguists and researchers in mind, TELP allows users to easily define and extract complex linguistic patterns from a vast array of web resources. Whether you are conducting a study in discourse relations, exploring syntactic structures, or building corpora for under-resourced languages, TELP provides the precision and ease of use required for comprehensive linguistic analysis.

The application addresses a significant gap in the availability of user-friendly tools tailored for linguistic pattern extraction. Existing web crawlers and text extraction tools are often too general or require substantial technical expertise, making them unsuitable for targeted linguistic research. TELP bridges this gap by offering a highly configurable yet easy-to-use interface that empowers researchers from diverse backgrounds to gather relevant linguistic data efficiently.

TELP is particularly valuable for linguistic studies involving under-resourced languages, where the lack of adequate corpora and resources can hinder research progress. By leveraging TELP's capabilities, researchers can automatically collect and analyze large volumes of text, uncovering patterns and insights that contribute to understanding and preserving linguistic diversity.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplified GUI that allows for quick learning and broad usage by non-technical users.
